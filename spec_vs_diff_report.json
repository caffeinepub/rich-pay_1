  "summary": "The diff implements all aspects of REQ-18. The employee AddBankAccountPage now uses session.userId as the employeeId, saves to localStorage via addBankAccountToStorage with 'pending' status, the MyBankAccountsPage fetches and displays only that employee's accounts via useGetMyBankAccounts, the admin AllBankAccountsPage reads all accounts from localStorage and resolves employee names, and the admin MyAccountsPage is kept independent using employeeId='admin'. All required fields (bank name, account holder name, account number, IFSC code, account type) are present. No missing requirements or hallucinated features were identified.",
